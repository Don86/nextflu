		<b>We expect clade 3c2.a viruses to continue to predominate over 3c3.a and 3c3.b viruses. Diversity within 3c2.a is beginning to accrue with the emergence of several clades of appreciable frequency, the most notable of which is the 171K/77V clade that has very recently risen to high frequency.</b>

		<div class="spacer"></div>

		Throughout 2015, clade 3c2.a viruses predominated over 3c3.a and 3c3.b viruses. The only exception to this trend has been the recent reemergence of 3c3.a viruses in Europe. However, this clade of European 3c3.a viruses lacks recent amino acid substitutions relative to the 3c3.a parent. Thus it appears that the reemergence of 3c3.a viruses in Europe is due to epidemiological factors, rather than genetic factors. In addition, we estimate that 3c2.a viruses still predominate in Europe over 3c3.a viruses despite their recent uptick and 3c3.a isolates have been declining in recent weeks.

		Within clade 3c2.a, there have emerged multiple circulating amino acid variants including HA1:114T, HA1:142K/197R and (HA1:171K, HA2:77V/155E). The substitution 171K has emerged twice within 3c3.a. The earlier substitution did not spread far, however, the recent substitution has occurred alongside HA2:77V/155E and has recently risen in frequency.

		{% embed_image /reports/figures/feb-2016/H3N2_3c2a_tree.png 12 %}

		The 114T variant peaked in frequency around July 2015 and similarly the 142K variant has been around for more than a year with a low but even geographic distribution. Consequently, we expect neither of these variants to be under strong positive selection. The T160K mutation is observed scattered within clade 3c2.a and overrepresented in sequences obtained from cultured virus. However, we observe a recent rapid increase in frequency of (HA1:171K, HA2:77V/155E) especially in Asia and North America. This has been the fastest growing variant within 3c2.a that we have observed. This clade also shows <a href="http://elifesciences.org/content/3/e03568v1/abstract">rapid phylogenetic branching</a>, corroborating its rapid rise. Barring substantial changes in other clades, we predict the (HA1:171K, HA2:77V/155E) variant to dominate.

		Due to poorly performing HI assays on 3c2.a samples and the lack of recent data, antigenic diversity within 3c2.a is hard to assess. The data available to us do not suggest significant antigenic evolution. Here we show recent antigenic data using sera against A/HongKong/5738/2014 from the Crick Worldwide Influenza Centre alongside model fits. Cooler color indicate greater antigenic similarity.

		<b>Within clade 6b, the clade 6b.1, comprising 84N/162N/216T, has rapidly risen to predominate the H1N1pdm population in the latter half of 2015. Although there is no obvious serological evidence for antigenic novelty of 6b.1, its extremely rapid rise in frequency a selective mechanism promoting its spread.</b>

		<div class="spacer"></div>

		Within clade 6b, genetic variants have begun to emerge, most notably HA1:84N/162N/216T, referred to here as clade 6b.1, and (HA1:152T, HA2:174E), referred to here as clade 6b.2.

		{% embed_image /reports/figures/feb-2016/H1N1pdm_tree.png 12 %}

		With the exception of China, all regions of the world are now dominated by 6b.1 (with the caveat that most recent data comes from Europe and data on almost all other regions is sparse). The 84N substitution rose in frequency around April 2015 and 162N followed around October 2015. China and Oceania have seen a recent rise in 6b.2 viruses. Recent samples from China have been dominated by 6b.2 viruses.

		{% embed_image /reports/figures/feb-2016/H1N1pdm_mutations.png 12 %}

		The 6b.1 clade comprising 84N/162N/216T rose from very low counts in early summer 2015 to almost 100% by early 2016 in Europe and North America. This clade is also singled out by the local branching index as the clade most likely to persist. The rapid rise of 6b.1 viruses is likely selective in origin. Along these lines, we observe a very slight drop in titer associated with the 84N substitution of approximately 0.5 log2 HI dilutions. We lack antigenic data to catalog an effect from the 162N, 216T or 152T substitutions. Here we show recent antigenic data from the Crick Worldwide Influenza Centre alongside model fits.

		{% embed_image /reports/figures/feb-2016/H1N1pdm_HI.png 12 %}

		Generally, we would not expect such a minor antigenic effect to have a major selective advantage. It was previously suggested that the cause of the 2013-2014 H1N1pdm season was due to antigenic changes via K163Q despite a lack of an effect on naive ferret antisera (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/111/44/15798">Linderman et al</a>). The corresponds to the previous increase in frequency of 6b viruses. Here, we observe a significantly faster take off of 6b.1 viruses than observed for 6b, with 6b.1 viruses reaching high frequency in ~6 months time rather than the ~12 months required for clade 6b.

		<b>Within clade 1A viruses, there are few examples of selectively interesting clades. The clade 129D/146I/117V has risen to high frequency, but at a rate that suggests little effect from natural selection.</b>

		<div class="spacer"></div>
		{% embed_image /reports/figures/feb-2016/Vic_mutations.png 12 %}
		North American and European isolates almost all contain 129D. While the majority of North American isolates also contains 117V, the most recent European isolates are ancestral with 117I instead of 117V. Recent isolates from the Southern hemisphere (and some Hong Kong isolates) are from the highly derived clade 124A/56K.

		No prominent amino acid substitutions are observed within the 117V clade, but this clade has been growing most strongly and is picked by the local branching index as the putatively most successful clade.

		<b>Clade 3 has predominated the B/Yamagata population with the recent emergence and spread of the substitution HA1:172Q. At this point clade 2 viruses are close to extinct.</b>

		Within clade 3, 251V has been slowly rising to frequencies close to 100% in all geographic regions analyzed differentially. The model of HI data assigns a modest titer drop of about 0.3 units to the branch to which 251V is assigned. Within the clade 251V there are multiple subclades of intermediate size, one of which predominates in China. None of them exhibit a particularly striking dynamics.
