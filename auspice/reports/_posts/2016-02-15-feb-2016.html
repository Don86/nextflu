		<b>We expect clade 3c2.a viruses to continue to predominate over 3c3.a and 3c3.b viruses. Diversity within 3c2.a is beginning to accrue with the emergence of several clades of appreciable frequency, the most notable of which is the 171K/77V clade that has very recently risen to high frequency.</b>

		The most prominent amino acid variants circulating within clade 3c2a are (HA1:171K, HA2:77V/155E), HA1:142K/197R and HA1:114T. The highly derived variant including 171K has risen quickly to high frequencies especially in Asia and North America, while the 142K clade has been around for more than a year with a low but even geographic distribution.

		With the (HA1:171K, HA2:77V/155E), an even more rapidly growing clade has reverted the recent T160K mutation suggesting fierce adaptive dynamics within this clade. This subclade also has the highest local branching index when using sequences within the past 6 month.

		3c3a viruses experienced a brief come back in Europe and transiently accounted for about a third of the reported cases. It seems, however, that this clade (containing HA1:94H) retreating. Barring substantial changes in other clades, we predict the (HA1:171K, HA2:77V/155E) variant to dominate.

		<b>Within clade 6b, the clade 6b.1, comprising 84N/162N/216T, has rapidly risen to predominate the H1N1pdm population in the latter half of 2015. Although there is not obvious serological evidence for antigenic novelty of 6b.1, its extremely rapid rise in frequency a selective mechanism promoting its spread.</b>

		With the exception of China, all regions of the world are dominated by 6b.1 (with the caveat that most data comes from Europe and data on almost all other regions is sparse). China has seen a recent rise in 6b.2 viruses forming a tight cluster along with a global sample of isolates.

		Within the 6b.2 clade, a subclade defined by 162N/216T has been rising from very low counts in early summer 2015 to almost 100% by early 2016. This subclade predominates on Europe and North America and is singled out by the LBI as the clade most likely to persist. <!-- Tone done, add tree blow ups? -->

		<b>Within clade 1A viruses, there are few examples of selectively interesting clades. The clade 129D/146I/117V has risen to high frequency, but at a rate that suggests little effect from natural selection.</b>
