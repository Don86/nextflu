		<b>We expect clade 3c2.a viruses to continue to predominate over 3c3.a and 3c3.b viruses. Diversity within 3c2.a is beginning to accrue with the emergence of several clades of appreciable frequency, the most notable of which is the 171K/77V clade that has very recently risen to high frequency.</b>

		<div class="spacer"></div>

		Throughout 2015, clade 3c2.a viruses predominated over 3c3.a and 3c3.b viruses. The only exception to this trend here been the recent reemergence of 3c3.a viruses in Europe. However, this clade of European 3c3.a viruses lacks recent amino acid substitutions relative to the 3c3.a parent. Thus it appears that the reemergence of 3c3.a viruses in Europe is due to epidemiological factors, rather than genetics factors. In addition, we estimate that 3c2.a viruses still predominate in Europe over 3c3.a viruses despite their recent uptick.

		Within clade 3c2.a, there have emerged multiple circulating amino acid variants including HA1:114T, HA1:142K/197R, (HA1:171K, HA2:77V/155E). The substitution 171K has emerged twice within 3c3.a. The earlier substitution did not spread far, however, the recent substitution has occurred alongside HA2:77V/155E and has recently risen in frequency.

		{% embed_image /reports/figures/feb-2016/H3N2_3c2a_tree.png 12 %}

		The 114T variant peaked in frequency in summer 2015 and similarly the 142K variant has been around for more than a year with a low but even geographic distribution. Consequently, we expect neither of these variants to be under strong positive selection. However, the highly derived variant including 171K has risen quickly to high frequencies especially in Asia and North America. This has been the fastest growing variant within 3c2.a that we have observed. Is also is the clade with the highest local branching index when using sequences within the past 6 month.

		3c3a viruses experienced a brief come back in Europe and transiently accounted for about a third of the reported cases. It seems, however, that this clade (containing HA1:94H) retreating. Barring substantial changes in other clades, we predict the (HA1:171K, HA2:77V/155E) variant to dominate.

		<b>Within clade 6b, the clade 6b.1, comprising 84N/162N/216T, has rapidly risen to predominate the H1N1pdm population in the latter half of 2015. Although there is not obvious serological evidence for antigenic novelty of 6b.1, its extremely rapid rise in frequency a selective mechanism promoting its spread.</b>

		With the exception of China, all regions of the world are dominated by 6b.1 (with the caveat that most data comes from Europe and data on almost all other regions is sparse). China has seen a recent rise in 6b.2 viruses forming a tight cluster along with a global sample of isolates.

		Within the 6b.2 clade, a subclade defined by 162N/216T has been rising from very low counts in early summer 2015 to almost 100% by early 2016. This subclade predominates on Europe and North America and is singled out by the LBI as the clade most likely to persist. <!-- Tone done, add tree blow ups? -->

		<b>Within clade 1A viruses, there are few examples of selectively interesting clades. The clade 129D/146I/117V has risen to high frequency, but at a rate that suggests little effect from natural selection.</b>

		<div class="spacer"></div>
		{% embed_image /reports/figures/feb-2016/Vic_mutations.png 12 %}
		North American and European isolates almost all contain 129D. While the majority of North American isolates also contains 117V, the most recent European isolates are ancestral with 117I instead of 117V. Recent isolates from the Southern hemisphere (and some Hong Kong isolates) are from the highly derived clade 124A/56K.

		No prominent amino acid substitutions are observed within the 117V clade, but this clade has been growing most strongly and is picked by the local branching index as the putatively most successful clade.

		<b>Clade 3 has predominated the B/Yamagata population with the recent emergence and spread of the substitution HA1:172Q. At this point clade 2 viruses are close to extinct.</b>

		Within clade 3, 251V has been slowly rising to frequencies close to 100% in all geographic regions analyzed differentially. The model of HI data assigns a modest titer drop of about 0.3 units to the branch to which 251V is assigned. Within the clade 251V there are multiple subclades of intermediate size, one of which predominates in China. None of them exhibit a particularly striking dynamics.
