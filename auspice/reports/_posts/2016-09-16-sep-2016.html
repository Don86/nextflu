		<!-- Discussion of sampling -->

    We base our primary analysis on a set of viruses collected between Sep 2015 and Aug 2016, comprising approximately 100 viruses per month where available and seeking to equilibriate sample counts geographically where possible. This equilibration attempts to collect equal samples from Africa, China, Europe, Japan/South Korea, North America, Oceania, South America, South Asia, Southeast Asia and West Asia. In the following analysis we collapse samples from China, Southeast Asia, Japan and Korea into a single region that we're calling "East Asia", resulting in East Asia possessing greater sample counts than North America or Europe. The only month that significantly departs from equitable sampling is Aug 2016 with 38 viruses, primarily from Europe and North America. We subsample to 100 viruses per month and not more to keep sample counts as equitable as possible across space and time.

		<!-- Discussion of older 3c3.a, 3c3.b and 3c2.a clades -->

    Viral clades 3c3.a, 3c3.b and 3c2.a emerged from the Texas/2012 background in early 2014 and rapidly spread through the viral population. Subsequently, we have observed competition among these clades, with 3c2.a viruses being globally dominant beginning in 2015. Recently, we have observed the steady decline of 3c3.b viruses. At this point, we estimate that they are either extinct or nearly extinct. 3c3.a viruses were largely replaced by 3c2.a viruses starting in 2015. However, we have observed an anomolous late-season epidemic of 3c3.a viruses within the USA from Jan to Aug 2016. Elsewhere in the world, 3c2.a viruses have remained dominant, particularly in E Asia, where we estimate 3c2.a frequencies to be >95% throughout 2016.

		<!-- Discussion of late season 3c2.a viruses in the USA -->

    The late-season 3c3.a epidemic in the USA is puzzling. However, we suspect that this epidemic is due to epidemiologic circumstance rather than the emergence of a antigenically novel variant. The strongest evidence for this is that there is not a single clade within 3c3.a that is spreading throughout the USA. Instead, a variety of 3c3.a viruses are spreading, each with different HA1 mutations. The emergence and spread of an adaptive variant would have appeared as a single clade bearing a characteristic epitope mutation. This is not what we see. Because of this, we highly doubt that these 3c3.a viruses will spread globally. It is conceivable however, that the 2016-2017 USA epidemic could derive from over-summering transmission chains. This would be an unusual event, but not unheard of (<a href="http://bedford.io/papers/bedford-global-migration/">Bedford et al. 2010</a>).

		<!-- Discussion of variation within 3c2.a -->

    The dominant 3c2.a viruses have continued to genetically diversify with emergence of multiple subclades. We observe 3 subclades of decent frequency in 2016 viruses. These are characterized by HA1 mutations 142K/197R, HA1 mutation 197K and HA1 mutation 171K + HA2 mutations 77V/155E. The 171K variant comprises approximately 54% of 3c2.a viruses collected in 2016.

    <!-- Discussion of dynamics within 3c2.a and rise of 171K -->

    The 142K/197R clade first emerged around June 2015 and rose to nearly 20% global frequency in Nov 2015. However, it's declined throughout 2016. We doubt this is a competitive virus. The 197K clade emerged in late 2015 and has slowly grown in frequency since. We estimate that it now comprises ~14% of H3N2 viruses. Notably however, 197K is at extremely low frequency in East Asia with an estimated present-day frequency ~2%. On the other hand, clade 171K viruses have done remarkdably well throughout 2016 and now comprise an estimated 69% of global H3N2 viruses.
