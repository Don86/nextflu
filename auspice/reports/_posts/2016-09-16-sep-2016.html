		<b>Despite the late season 3c3.a epidemic in the USA, we clade 3c2.a viruses to continue to predominate in the H3N2 population. Within clade 3c2.a, the 171K subclade has rapidly with the majority of recent H3N2 infections outside the USA being comprised of 171K viruses.</b>

		<!-- Discussion of sampling -->

    We base our primary analysis on a set of viruses collected between Sep 2015 and Aug 2016, comprising approximately 100 viruses per month where available and seeking to equilibriate sample counts geographically where possible. This equilibration attempts to collect equal samples from Africa, China, Europe, Japan/South Korea, North America, Oceania, South America, South Asia, Southeast Asia and West Asia. In the following analysis we collapse samples from China, Southeast Asia, Japan and Korea into a single region that we're calling "East Asia", resulting in East Asia possessing greater sample counts than North America or Europe. The only month that significantly departs from equitable sampling is Aug 2016 with 38 viruses, primarily from Europe and North America. We subsample to 100 viruses per month and not more to keep sample counts as equitable as possible across space and time.
