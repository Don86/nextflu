		<b>Clade 3c2.a has continued to diversify genetically with a complicated and rapid dynamics of different subclades. This diversification is not evident in serological data that shows only minor to moderate antigenic evolution.</b>

		<!-- Discussion of sampling -->

    <p>We base our primary analysis on a set of viruses collected between Jan 2015 and Feb 2017. We analyze mutation frequency trajectories separately in different geographic regions using all available sequence data. Our phylogenetic analysis is based on a subsample of approximately 100 viruses per month where available and seeking to equilibrate sample counts geographically where possible. This equilibration attempts to collect equal samples from Africa, China, Europe, Japan/South Korea, North America, Oceania, South America, South Asia, Southeast Asia and West Asia. In the following analysis we collapse samples from China, South Asia, Southeast Asia, Japan and Korea into a single region referred to here as "Asia", resulting in Asia possessing greater sample counts than North America or Europe. The only month that significantly departs from equitable sampling is Aug 2016 with 38 viruses, primarily from Europe and North America. We subsample to 100 viruses per month and not more to keep sample counts as equitable as possible across space and time. Repeating mutation and clade frequency calculations with up to 1200 viruses per month yields similar results (see below).

		<!-- Discussion of older 3c3.a, 3c3.b and 3c2.a clades -->

    <p>Of the clades that emerged from the Texas/2012 background in early 2014, only 3c2.a remains. The late season uptick of 3c3.a epidemic in US has disappeared and 3c3.b has not been observed in substantial numbers for a year. Within clade 3c2.a, a number of subclades with signature mutation N171K, T131K/R142K, R142K, N121K/R144K, Q197K have emerged. The largest of them is the 171K clade which was first observed in mid 2015 and is now globally at a frequency of 80%.
    Clades R142K, N121K/R144K, Q197K arose in late 2014 or early 2015 but have not come to dominate.
    The only noteworthy sister clade of 171K is the clade with mutations T131K/R142K. This clade was first observed mid-2016 in China and has rapidly dominated China according to sequences available in GISAID. It has been one of the most rapidly rising clades and has spread to Europe and North America. In the branch leading up to this clade, we observe a rapid succession of mutation in codon 131 from threonine to asparagine to lysine. Multiple mutations in the same codon suggest that these changes are adaptive.
